i. OVERVIEW
-----------------------------

This gait recognition demo needs clean background, e.g. a white wall. 
As this demo only takes GEI as its feature, so it can only recognize 
the same view. For example, people walk with the same angle for both 
registration and recognition.

This code is one part of the Tutorial of ICPR 2016.
